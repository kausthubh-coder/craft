## Interaction States

> Every control has more than one face.

A button is usually designed once, at rest. But people meet it in five other
states: hovered, pressed, focused from the keyboard, disabled and loading. If
nobody designed those, the browser or the component library did.

**Design every state a control can be in, not just the one in the mockup.**

> **Interactive demo: Interaction States.** Open https://craft.gustavofior.com/interaction-states to try it.

Each state answers a different question. Hover says "this is clickable".
Pressed says "I felt that". Focus says "you are here". Disabled says "not
now", and loading says "working on it". Here hover lightens the fill by 15%,
pressed by 20% with a [0.97 press](https://craft.gustavofior.com/button-press), disabled drops to 40%
opacity, and loading swaps the label for a spinner while keeping its width,
so nothing next to it moves.

### Hover must not move anything

Hover should change color, never size. Bold text is wider than regular text,
so a hover that switches font weight pushes every neighbor sideways. Sweep the
pointer across both rows and watch the dashed edge.

> **Interactive demo: Hover Shift.** Open https://craft.gustavofior.com/interaction-states to try it.

Hover also has no place on touch screens, where a tap can leave it stuck on
until you tap somewhere else. Keep hover styles inside `@media (hover: hover)`.
Tailwind v4's `hover:` variant already does this. How fast hover should appear
is its own topic: see [hover restraint](https://craft.gustavofior.com/hover-restraint).

### Disabled needs a reason

A greyed-out button tells you something is wrong without telling you what. It
can't be focused, so keyboard and screen reader users may never find it, and
a tooltip on it can't be reached from the keyboard.

> **Interactive demo: Disabled Reason.** Open https://craft.gustavofior.com/interaction-states to try it.

Keep the button enabled, and when it is pressed, say what is missing and move
focus to the field. If you really must disable a control, put the reason in
visible text next to it.

### Usage

**Tailwind**

```html
<button
  class="bg-neutral-900 transition-transform duration-100 ease-out
         hover:bg-neutral-900/85
         active:scale-[0.97]
         focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2
         disabled:opacity-40"
>
  Save
</button>
```

**CSS**

```css
.button {
  background: rgb(23 23 23);
  transition: transform 100ms ease-out;
}

@media (hover: hover) {
  .button:hover {
    background: rgb(23 23 23 / 0.85);
  }
}

.button:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}

.button:active {
  transform: scale(0.97);
}

.button:disabled {
  opacity: 0.4;
}
```

Loading is a state, not a disabled button. Keep it focusable with
`aria-busy="true"` and ignore repeat clicks in the handler. Disabling the
focused button would drop focus to the page while the request runs.

## Focus Rings

> Show keyboard users where they are.

- Section: Interaction
- URL: https://craft.gustavofior.com/focus-rings
- Published: 2026-10-02

A focus ring is the keyboard's cursor. Without it, someone pressing Tab is
moving through the page blind. It gets removed so often because it used to show
up on mouse clicks too, and designers found that ugly.

**Never remove the focus ring. Style `:focus-visible` instead.**

> **Interactive demo: Focus Rings.** Open https://craft.gustavofior.com/focus-rings to try it.

With `:focus`, every mouse click on a button draws a ring. With
`:focus-visible`, the browser shows it only when it helps: always for keyboard
focus, and for text fields however they were focused, since you are about to
type.

### Outline, not box-shadow

A 2px solid `outline` with a 2px `outline-offset` is a good default. The offset
leaves a gap, so the ring reads as separate from the control even when they
are the same color. Outlines follow `border-radius` in every major browser, so
a pill gets a pill-shaped ring.

> **Interactive demo: Focus Offset.** Open https://craft.gustavofior.com/focus-rings to try it.

Rings drawn with `box-shadow` look the same, until someone turns on forced
colors mode, such as Windows contrast themes. The browser drops shadows there
and repaints outlines in the system colors. Here it is simulated:

> **Interactive demo: Focus Forced Colors.** Open https://craft.gustavofior.com/focus-rings to try it.

If you need a shadow ring for its looks, keep a `2px solid transparent` outline
next to it. It is invisible until forced colors paints it.

### Don't hide it under the header

A sticky header can cover the element you just moved to. Shift+Tab up through
a list and the browser scrolls each row to the top edge, right under the
header. WCAG 2.2 asks that focus is never fully hidden this way.

> **Interactive demo: Focus Obscured.** Open https://craft.gustavofior.com/focus-rings to try it.

`scroll-padding-top` tells the scroller how much of its top edge is taken. Set
it to the header's height plus a little air, here 36px + 4px. On a page with a
sticky site header, put it on `html`.

### Usage

**Tailwind**

```html
<!-- 64px: sticky header height + air -->
<html class="scroll-pt-16">

<button
  class="focus-visible:outline-2
         focus-visible:outline-offset-2
         focus-visible:outline-neutral-900"
>
  Invite
</button>
```

**CSS**

```css
html {
  scroll-padding-top: 64px; /* sticky header height + air */
}

:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid rgb(23 23 23);
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

In Tailwind v4, `outline-none` really removes the outline, in forced colors
too. Use `outline-hidden` when you replace it with a ring, which keeps the
transparent outline for forced colors mode.

## Input Details

> Small attributes that make typing easy.

- Section: Interaction
- URL: https://craft.gustavofior.com/input-details
- Published: 2026-10-02

Most of what makes a form pleasant on a phone is invisible. The right keyboard
appears, the page doesn't jump, the browser offers your email before you type
it. Each of those is one attribute.

**Tell the browser what each field is for, and it does the rest.**

> **Interactive demo: Input Keyboard.** Open https://craft.gustavofior.com/input-details to try it.

Tap a few fields in each mode. Safari on iPhone zooms in on any input with text
under 16px, and it stays zoomed after you leave. A `16px` font size stops
it. Don't disable zooming to fix it.

### Type, inputmode, autocomplete

`type` sets what the value is, `inputmode` sets which keyboard appears, and
`autocomplete` says what to fill in. `type="email"` brings the @ key,
`type="tel"` the phone pad, `inputmode="decimal"` digits with a point. Use
`inputmode="numeric"` rather than `type="number"` for codes, card numbers and
anything else that isn't a quantity. `autocomplete="one-time-code"` lets the
phone offer the code it just received.

Two more rules: wrap fields in a `<form>`, so Enter submits, and never block
paste. People paste passwords and codes from somewhere safer than their memory.

### When to show errors

An error that appears after the first letter scolds people for not having
finished. Type an email in both modes.

> **Interactive demo: Input Validation.** Open https://craft.gustavofior.com/input-details to try it.

Wait until the person leaves the field, then check it. Once an error is
showing, check again on every keystroke and remove it the moment the value is
valid. GOV.UK goes further and validates only on submit. I prefer blur on short
forms, where hearing about a typo right away saves a trip back.

CSS has this built in: `:user-invalid` matches only after someone has changed
a field and moved on, or tried to submit.

### Usage

**Tailwind**

```html
<form>
  <input
    class="text-base user-invalid:outline-2 user-invalid:outline-red-500"
    type="email"
    autocomplete="email"
    spellcheck="false"
    required
  />
  <input class="text-base" inputmode="numeric" autocomplete="one-time-code" />
</form>
```

**CSS**

```css
input {
  font-size: 16px;
}

input:user-invalid {
  outline: 2px solid rgb(239 68 68);
}
```

Keep the submit button enabled until the request starts, and on submit move
focus to the first field with an error.

## Empty States

> Say why it's empty and what to do next.

- Section: Interaction
- URL: https://craft.gustavofior.com/empty-states
- Published: 2026-10-02
- Source: https://github.com/gustavo-fior/craft/blob/main/content/interaction/empty-states.mdx

A new user's first screen is usually empty. No projects, no messages, no data.
Whatever sits there is their introduction to the feature, and "No data." doesn't
introduce anything.

**An empty state should say why it's empty, what goes here, and offer one clear
next action.**

> **Interactive demo: Empty States.** Open https://craft.gustavofior.com/empty-states to try it.

With "No data." the only way forward is the small plus in the corner, if you
notice it. The designed version names the thing, says what it's for in one
line, and puts the action where your eyes already are. Add a project and
delete it again: the empty state comes back whenever the list does, so it's
not a one-time screen.

### Three kinds of empty

Empty screens don't all mean the same thing, so they shouldn't all say the same
thing.

- **First use.** Nothing has been made yet. Teach the feature and offer the first action.
- **No results.** The data exists, but a query or filter hid it. Help the person change the query.
- **Cleared.** The person finished everything. Say so and stop there.

### No results

An empty search is one the person caused, so the fix is usually in their own
input. Echo the query so a typo is easy to spot. If a filter is hiding a match,
say so and offer to remove it.

> **Interactive demo: Empty Search.** Open https://craft.gustavofior.com/empty-states to try it.

"Brand refresh" exists, it's just archived. "No results." makes it look like it
was never there. The designed version counts what the filter hid and turns that
into a button.

### Cleared

Inbox zero is the one empty state that has earned some delight. It's rare, it's
the reward for finishing, and it's the best place to spend your
[novelty budget](https://craft.gustavofior.com/novelty-budget). A check mark and a short line are enough. There
is nothing left to do, so don't add a button.

GitHub's Primer asks first-use screens to be playful. Atlassian saves the
excitement for finished work. I side with Atlassian: on first use the person is
trying to learn something, and a joke gets between them and the button.

### Usage

**Tailwind**

```html
<div class="flex h-48 flex-col items-center justify-center gap-3 text-center">
  <p class="text-sm font-medium">No projects yet</p>
  <p class="max-w-56 text-sm text-pretty text-muted-foreground">
    A project keeps tasks, files and people in one place.
  </p>
  <button class="rounded-full bg-foreground px-3 py-1.5 text-sm text-background">
    New project
  </button>
</div>
```

**React**

```tsx
if (projects.length > 0) return <ProjectList projects={projects} />;

if (query) {
  return (
    <EmptyState
      title={`No projects match “${query}”`}
      description="Check the spelling, or try a shorter word."
      action={<Button onClick={clearSearch}>Clear search</Button>}
    />
  );
}

return (
  <EmptyState
    title="No projects yet"
    description="A project keeps tasks, files and people in one place."
    action={<Button onClick={createProject}>New project</Button>}
  />
);
```

Give the empty state the same height as the list it replaces. Otherwise the
page jumps when the first item arrives and again when the last one leaves.

## Command Menu

> One shortcut to reach everything.

- Section: Interaction
- URL: https://craft.gustavofior.com/command-menu
- Published: 2026-10-02
- Source: https://github.com/gustavo-fior/craft/blob/main/content/interaction/command-menu.mdx

A command menu puts every action behind one shortcut. Press Cmd+K, or Ctrl+K on
Windows, type a few letters, press Enter. Nobody has to remember where a
setting lives, only roughly what it does.

**Open it instantly, match what people mean, and show each command's shortcut
next to it.**

> **Interactive demo: Command Menu.** Open https://craft.gustavofior.com/command-menu to try it.

Click the window and press the shortcut, or use the search field. Arrows move,
Enter runs, Escape closes. Run "Toggle sidebar" from the menu and the footer
tells you the shortcut for next time.

### Open it instantly

The menu exists to make things fast, so it can't be slow to appear. It opens
with no animation, the cursor is already in the input, and the same shortcut
closes it. This is [hover restraint](https://craft.gustavofior.com/hover-restraint) again: something you open
forty times a day can't afford a fade.

Closing returns focus to the search field, and nothing in the list needs a mouse.

### Match what people mean

People don't type your label, they type their own word. Someone looking for
dark mode types "dark", not "Change theme". An exact search finds nothing, and
they decide the feature doesn't exist.

> **Interactive demo: Command Search.** Open https://craft.gustavofior.com/command-menu to try it.

Give every command a few keywords and match loosely against the title and the
keywords together. When a keyword matched, show it next to the result so the
match doesn't look random.

### Teach the shortcuts

A command menu is also where people learn your shortcuts. If every row shows
its keys, the tenth time someone runs "Toggle sidebar" from the menu, they press
the shortcut instead. A shortcut nobody sees never gets learned.

> **Interactive demo: Command Shortcuts.** Open https://craft.gustavofior.com/command-menu to try it.

Order the list for the person, not the codebase. With an empty query, show
recent commands first, then the ones that fit the current screen. Most of the
time, the thing someone wants is the thing they did a minute ago.

### Usage

**React**

```tsx
import { Command } from "cmdk";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export function CommandMenu() {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const onKeyDown = (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
      if (event.key === "k" && (event.metaKey || event.ctrlKey)) {
        event.preventDefault();
        setOpen((open) => !open);
      }
    };
    document.addEventListener("keydown", onKeyDown);
    return () => document.removeEventListener("keydown", onKeyDown);
  }, []);

  return (
    <Command.Dialog open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen} label="Command menu">
      <Command.Input placeholder="Type a command" />
      <Command.List>
        <Command.Empty>No commands found.</Command.Empty>
        <Command.Item
          value="Change theme"
          keywords={["dark mode", "light mode", "appearance"]}
          onSelect={toggleTheme}
        >
          Change theme
          <kbd className="ml-auto text-xs text-muted-foreground">⌘⇧L</kbd>
        </Command.Item>
      </Command.List>
    </Command.Dialog>
  );
}
```

**Tailwind**

```html
<div
  cmdk-item
  class="flex h-8 items-center gap-2.5 rounded-lg px-2.5 text-sm data-[selected=true]:bg-muted"
>
  Change theme
  <kbd class="ml-auto text-xs text-muted-foreground">⌘⇧L</kbd>
</div>
```

Set `value` on every item. Without it, cmdk uses the item's text, so the
shortcut becomes part of what it searches and "L" starts matching "Change
theme".

## Overlays

> Keep scroll and focus inside the layer.

- Section: Interaction
- URL: https://craft.gustavofior.com/overlays
- Published: 2026-10-02
- Source: https://github.com/gustavo-fior/craft/blob/main/content/interaction/overlays.mdx

A modal says everything else is on hold until you're done here. Two things
quietly break that. Scrolling leaks out to the page behind, and focus wanders
off when the layer opens or closes.

### Scroll

Scroll the list below to the end and keep going. Once the list runs out, the
browser hands the scroll to the next scrollable thing behind it, and the page
starts moving. This is called scroll chaining.

> **Interactive demo: Overlay Scroll.** Open https://craft.gustavofior.com/overlays to try it.

One line stops it. `overscroll-behavior: contain` keeps the scroll inside the
element even at its edges, and keeps the bounce from leaking out too. Put it on
every scroll area inside an overlay: the dialog body, a drawer, a long menu.

### Focus

**When an overlay opens, focus goes in. When it closes, focus goes back to
the button that opened it.**

Open one of the fields, then close it with Save, Cancel, Escape or a click on
the backdrop.

> **Interactive demo: Overlay Focus.** Open https://craft.gustavofior.com/overlays to try it.

In the unmanaged version focus stays behind the dialog, so Tab walks through
buttons you can't use. When the dialog closes, the element that had focus is
removed and focus falls back to the page body. A keyboard or screen reader user
has lost their place and has to find it again.

The managed version moves focus to the input, keeps Tab cycling inside the
dialog, and makes the page behind `inert` so nothing there can be reached.
Escape and a backdrop click close it, and focus lands back on the button you
pressed.

Only let the backdrop close overlays that are cheap to reopen, like menus,
pickers and previews. If closing would throw away typing or skip a destructive
choice, make people press a button.

### Usage

`<dialog>` opened with `showModal()` does most of this for you. The rest of the
page becomes inert, Escape closes it, focus moves to the first focusable
element, and it returns to the trigger on close. The `closedby="any"` attribute
adds backdrop clicks, but it isn't Baseline yet, so the click handler below is
still the safe route.

**Tailwind**

```html
<button onclick="language.showModal()">Language</button>

<dialog
  id="language"
  class="rounded-xl p-0 backdrop:bg-black/20"
  onclick="event.target === this && this.close()"
>
  <ul class="max-h-64 overflow-y-auto overscroll-contain p-1">
    <li>English</li>
    <!-- … -->
  </ul>
</dialog>
```

**CSS**

```css
dialog {
  padding: 0;
}

dialog::backdrop {
  background: rgb(0 0 0 / 0.2);
}

dialog ul {
  max-height: 16rem;
  overflow-y: auto;
  overscroll-behavior: contain;
}
```

A modal dialog doesn't stop the page from scrolling when the wheel is over the
backdrop itself. If that matters, lock the root while it's open with
`html:has(dialog:modal) { overflow: hidden }`, and keep `contain` on the lists
for the scroll that starts inside.
